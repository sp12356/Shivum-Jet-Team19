temporalCoverage	CreativeWork	The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.

In cases where a CreativeWork has several media type representations, 'encoding' can be used to indicate each MediaObject alongside particular fileFormat information. Unregistered or niche file formats can be indicated instead via the most appropriate URL, e.g. defining Web page or a Wikipedia entry.

gtin	Demand  or
Offer  or
Product	A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items, including products and services, using numeric identification codes.

A correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged. The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and gtin14 properties.

The GS1 digital link specifications expresses GTINs as URLs (URIs, IRIs, etc.). Digital Links should be populated into the hasGS1DigitalLink attribute.

Note also that this is a definition for how to include GTINs in Schema.org data, and not a definition of GTINs in general - see the GS1 documentation for authoritative details.
hasGS1DigitalLink	Offer  or
Organization  or
Place  or
Product	The GS1 digital link associated with the object. This URL should conform to the particular requirements of digital links. The link should only contain the Application Identifiers (AIs) that are relevant for the entity being annotated, for instance a Product or an Organization, and for the correct granularity. In particular, for products:
A Digital Link that contains a serial number (AI 21) should only be present on instances of IndividualProduct
A Digital Link that contains a lot number (AI 10) should be annotated as SomeProduct if only products from that lot are sold, or IndividualProduct if there is only a specific product.
A Digital Link that contains a global model number (AI 8013) should be attached to a Product or a ProductModel.
Other item types should be adapted similarly.

Observation  or
PropertyValue  or
StatisticalVariable	A subproperty of measurementTechnique that can be used for specifying specific methods, in particular via MeasurementMethodEnum.
measurementTechnique	DataCatalog  or
DataDownload  or
Dataset  or
Observation  or
PropertyValue  or
StatisticalVariable	A technique, method or technology used in an Observation, StatisticalVariable or Dataset (or DataDownload, DataCatalog), corresponding to the method used for measuring the corresponding variable(s) (for datasets, described using variableMeasured; for Observation, a StatisticalVariable). Often but not necessarily each variableMeasured will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of variableMeasured called measuredProperty is applicable.

The measurementTechnique property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a measuredProperty was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.

For example, if variableMeasured is: molecule concentration, measurementTechnique could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the variableMeasured is "depression rating", the measurementTechnique could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".

If there are several variableMeasured properties recorded for some given data object, use a PropertyValue for each variableMeasured and attach the corresponding measurementTechnique. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a MeasurementMetholdEnumeration.

publishingPrinciples	CreativeWork  or
Organization  or
Person	The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via URL) a document describing the editorial principles of an Organization (or individual, e.g. a Person writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.

While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.

This property was created primarily to indicate the use of a specific schema.org release, e.g. 10.0 as a simple string, or more explicitly via URL, https://schema.org/docs/releases.html#v10.0. There may be situations in which other schemas might usefully be referenced this way, e.g. http://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dces/1999-07-02/ but this has not been carefully explored in the community.

speakable	Article  or
WebPage	Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.

The speakable property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:

1.) id-value URL references - uses id-value of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of speakable has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.

2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the cssSelector property.

3.) XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the xpath property.

For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, SpeakableSpecification which is defined to be a possible value of the speakable property.
sport	SportsEvent  or
SportsOrganization	A type of sport (e.g. Baseball).
statType	StatisticalVariable	Indicates the kind of statistic represented by a StatisticalVariable, e.g. mean, count etc. The value of statType is a property, either from within Schema.org (e.g. count, median, marginOfError, maxValue, minValue) or from other compatible (e.g. RDF) systems such as DataCommons.org or Wikidata.org.

taxonomicRange	BioChemEntity	The taxonomic grouping of the organism that expresses, encodes, or in some way related to the BioChemEntity.
temporalCoverage	CreativeWork	The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".

Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.
termsOfService	Service	Human-readable terms of service documentation.
thumbnailUrl	CreativeWork	A thumbnail image relevant to the Thing.
ticketToken	Ticket	Reference to an asset (e.g., Barcode, QR code image or PDF) usable for entrance.
titleEIDR	Movie  or

For example, the motion picture known as "Ghostbusters" has a titleEIDR of "10.5240/7EC7-228A-510A-053E-CBB8-J". This title (or work) may have several variants, which EIDR calls "edits". See editEIDR.

Since schema.org types like Movie, TVEpisode, TVSeason, and TVSeries can be used for both works and their multiple expressions, it is possible to use titleEIDR alone (for a general description), or alongside editEIDR for a more edit-specific description.
tourBookingPage	Accommodation  or
ApartmentComplex  or
Place	A page providing information on how to book a tour of some Place, such as an Accommodation or ApartmentComplex in a real estate setting, as well as other kinds of tours as appropriate.

usageInfo	CreativeWork	The schema.org usageInfo property indicates further information about a CreativeWork. This property is applicable both to works that are freely available and to those that require payment or other transactions. It can reference additional information, e.g. community expectations on preferred linking and citation conventions, as well as purchasing details. For something that can be commercially licensed, usageInfo can provide detailed, resource-specific information about licensing options.

This property can be used alongside the license property which indicates license(s) applicable to some piece of content. The usageInfo property can provide information about other licensing options, e.g. acquiring commercial usage rights for an image that is also available under non-commercial creative commons licenses.

cutoffTime	ShippingDeliveryTime	Order cutoff time allows merchants to describe the time after which they will no longer process orders received on that day. For orders processed after cutoff time, one day gets added to the delivery time estimate. This property is expected to be most typically used via the ShippingRateSettings publication pattern. The time is indicated using the ISO-8601 Time format, e.g. "23:30:00-05:00" would represent 6:30 pm Eastern Standard Time (EST) which is 5 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
